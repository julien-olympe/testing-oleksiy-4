RINGS 
you are going to create a combo of a messendger-social network, let's call it Rings.
A Ring is kind of a group, but basically a chatroom in which the users post messages and/or pics.

Login screen
The user can resister or log in

Home screen
lists news feed from the rings the user is part of. The News tiles contain the name of the Ring, The phote (if any) and the first 100 chars of the message it might contain.
Above there is a search bar to look for a ring by its name. If Searched, only the posts created in the Ring are listed in the News feed

Below the news we see the footer containing buttons:
Home, My Rings, Find Ring, Create Ring, Settings 

If clicked My Rings:
UI: A list of all the Rings the user is part of is shown with a search bar above to look for a ring
Each Ring item contains the name (ellipsized to 20 chars), the member count.

If clicked on an Ring item, the Ring Chat is shown
The user an add a message in the chat with or without a picture.
Once added, the post is shown in News feed for everybody part of the Ring
The user should also have a possibility to add other registered users in the Rings he is part of.

If clicked Find Ring
The search bar is shown and the search results below. The user can look for a Ring, if the ring is found, the Ring is listed in the list. THe user may apply for membership in the rings in which the user is not already part of.
Once joined the Ring, the join button is no longer shown for the user.

If clicked Create Ring,
The user should be able to set the Name of the Ring and be able to create the Ring.

If clicked Settings, the user should be anble to see the log out button and the username

The happy path: user registers, observes the news feed, creates a Ring, add a registered friend, clicks the My rings, chooses a Ring he is part of, posts a message with a pic, goes to home and sees the post in the news feed, The added friend logs in and sees the news too as he was added by the user.
